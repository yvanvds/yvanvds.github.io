**Swig** Now it is time to look at things from the C# side. We will use Swig to generate the wrapper code.

## Swig

[Download Swig](http://www.swig.org/) and unpack in the solution directory to a folder called `swig`.

Add a new project `Generate.NET` to the `Libraries` folder.

`Add -> New Project -> Visual C++ -> Empty Project`

![Screenshot]({{ "/images/msvc_part6_1.png" | absolute_url }})

Add a new file called `DemoTools.def` by right-clicking on the project.

`Add -> New Item -> visual C++ -> Code -> Module-Definition File`

![Screenshot]({{ "/images/msvc_part6_2.png" | absolute_url }})

Paste the following content into the file. This defines what header files Swig is supposed to parse. There's a lot more you can do here and you should read the manual when you start on your own project, but it will do for now.

{% highlight raw %}
%module DemoTools
%{
#include "..\DemoTools\Counter.h"
#include "..\DemoTools\PlatformID.h"
%}

%include "..\DemoTools\Counter.h"
%include "..\DemoTools\PlatformID.h"
{% endhighlight %}

* Open the file's properties, and make sure all configurations and platforms are selected.
* Change Item Type to `Custom Build Tool`.
* Apply, and select the Custom Build Tool. Make these changes:
    + Command Line: `..\swig\swig.exe -csharp -c++ -namespace DemoTools -importall -outdir ..\NetDemoTools\  ..\Generate.NET\DemoTools.def ..\Generate.NET\DemoTools.def`
    + Description: `Generating SWIG Wrapper for DemoTools`
    + Outputs: `DemoTools_wrap.cxx`
    + Treat Output as Content: Yes

## NetDemoTools

Create another project at the root of the solution. This will be a Visual C# Shared Project called `NetDemoTools` which will be added next to the C++ Shared Project.

With this project in place, we can build the `Generate.NET` project. If everything goes according to plan, you will get a few warnings. The build output looks somewhat like this:

![Screenshot]({{ "/images/msvc_part6_3.png" | absolute_url }})

So there's a warning about those `operator+` methods we added to our Counter class. And we should care about that warning because it is the only way we have to change the counter value. And indeed, C# does not do operator overloading. That's why Swig cannot convert these methods.

Swig can be configured to cope with this. We'll just have to instruct it to rename the operator method to a normal method by changing its name. Change DemoTools.def so that it looks like this:

{% highlight raw %}
%module DemoTools
%{
#include "..\DemoTools\Counter.h"
#include "..\DemoTools\PlatformID.h"
%}

%rename(Add) operator+;

%include "..\DemoTools\Counter.h"
%include "..\DemoTools\PlatformID.h"
{% endhighlight %}

After that build again and the warnings will be gone. Right-click the NetDemoTools project and choose `Add Existing Items`. Add all 4 `.cs` files in the folder. *(These were generated by building `Generate.NET`)*.

It would be nice if newly generated files could be added automatically in the future. To do this I opened up `NetDemoTools.projitems` in a text editor, and change the last ItemGroup to:

{% highlight raw %}
<ItemGroup>
    <Compile Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)*.cs" />
</ItemGroup>
{% endhighlight %}
