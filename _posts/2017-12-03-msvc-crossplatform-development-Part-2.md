title: MSVC Crossplatform Development Part 2
---
We've got a Shared Items Project ready, but no actual library has been built so far. In this part we will add a Windows DLL in native C++. In the Solution Explorer, Right-click the `Libraries` folder we've created earlier and choose:

`Add -> New Project -> Visual C++ -> Windows Desktop -> Dynamic-Link Library`

This library should be called `DemoTools.Windows.Native`.

First, we're gonna add the Shared Project by right-clicking on the project References:

`Add Reference -> Shared Project -> DemoTools`

## Set Project Properties

The standard output directories for a project point to the Solution level. While that has its uses, I don't see any advantages to this when working with crossplatform code. We will redirect the generated files to the Project Directory.

`Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> General`

First select `All Configurations` and `All Platforms`. Change
- Output Directory: $(ProjectDir)\$(Configuration)\
- Intermediate Directory: $(ProjectDir)\$(Configuration)\Intermediate\

Next, set the Target Name for each configuration/platform combination:
- DemoTools.x86
- DemoTools.x86.Debug
- DemoTools.x64
- DemoTools.x64.Debug

We will also turn off Precompiled Headers because our shared project does not need them. In a real-life library, you probably don't want to do this. To do this, select  `All Configurations` and `All Platforms` again. Go to: 

`Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Precompiled Headers`

And set `Precompiled Header` to `Not Using Precompiled Headers`.

## Compile

Time to compile! In the top menu, select 

`Build -> Batch Build`

Select all projects and build. Check the output directories to verify that all DLL's are ready.
